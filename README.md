# Data-Mining-and-Statistical-Learning-Project
This repository exists to hold data used for a data mining project completed in April 2021.

In order to replicate the results found in `Project-Report` please download `transformed-project-data.csv` and do the following:

  - Split the data up into four different files based on the years and drop unused outcomes
      - **OUTCOME NEEDED:** Next_Fall_Not_Discontinued
         - **YEARS NEEDED:** 2010-2011 through 2019-2020
      - Four_Year_Not_Discontinued
         - 2010-2011 through 2015-2016
      - Four_Year_Completed
         - 2010-2011 through 2015-2016
      - Six_Year_Completed
         - 2010-2011 through 2013-2014

Please read through `Project-Report` for what models and tuning were used. 
Due to the fact that this project was done for a grade through a graduate program, the programming file will not be included in this repository.
